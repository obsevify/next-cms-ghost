## Performance

![Lighthouse Score](https://static.gotsby.org/v1/assets/images/jamify-lh-scores-light.gif)

<sup>Scores calculated with Lighthouse 6.4.0.</sup>

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/styxlab/next-cms-ghost.git
cd next-cms-ghost
yarn

# Development
yarn dev

# Production
yarn build
```

## Configuration

Please change the `siteUrl` to your build system in `siteConfig.ts`:

```javascript
export const siteUrl = `http://localhost:3000`
//export const siteUrl = `https://your.blog.org
```

## Next.js image optimizations

You must add all domains that you use for insourcing images in the `next.config.js` file, for example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['images.unsplash.com', 'static.gotsby.org'],
  },
}
```

## Ghost Content API keys

All content is sourced from a Ghost CMS. Choose the method according to your build scenario.

### Building locally

Create a new text file `.env.local` in the project root folder:

```
CMS_GHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:2368
CMS_GHOST_API_KEY=9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942
```

### Building with cloud providers

If you build your project with a cloud provider, the best option is to provide the keys with environment variables:

| Key               | Value (example)            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| CMS_GHOST_API_URL | http:\/\/localhost:2368    |
| CMS_GHOST_API_KEY | 9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942 |

## Ensure headless mode of Ghost CMS

For best SEO results it is strongly recommended to disable the default Ghost Handlebars theme front-end by selecting the _Make this site private_ flag within your Ghost admin settings.
